What is This?
###################

This application is a basic CRUD application written in PHP with the Codeigniter Framework.

The application allows the user to:

1. Create a new Account for a User with the following basic information:
	a. Name
	b. Email
	c. Date of Birth
	d. Favorite Color

2. View a list of all users
3. Edit existing users
4. Soft-Delete Existing users

While simple, it is a demonstration of my abilities to create a CRUD application in Codeigniter, while applying MVC
concepts.

Included with this is also:

1. An SQL dump of a MySQL Database
2. All Views and Controllers

*******************
Release Information
*******************

PLEASE NOTE:

1. Host this on a machine with internet connectivity, so the CDN assets can load. (These were included for speed of development, would not be used in production this way).

2. Go to the application/config/database.php file to configure the database. It is cuurrently configured for what the settings are on my machine, where the default user is root, and password is cielotest.


**************************
Changelog and New Features
**************************

This is the initial deployment.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************

2. Turn on the Lamp Development Server.
